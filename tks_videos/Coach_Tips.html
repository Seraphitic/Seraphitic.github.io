						<h1>Welcome!</h1>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Welcome new TKS coaches. This is a quick slideshow that I hope will help you in your first year with The Knight School Chattanooga.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Because we all have varying levels of comfort and skill with both teaching kids and chess, I want to make sure that I share different 'tips and tricks' so to speak for both sets of skills.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							I also want to introduce a few common practices to which we should all adhere. Some will be mandatory as part of your contract. Some will be highly suggested to save work down the line.

						<h1>Chess Tips</h1>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							This section is going to cover certain things that will help your own game of chess. This won't be very detailed as chess is a very complicated game. There are many, better resources online that will help you better than I could here. However, it would be remiss of me to not include it.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Develop Your Pieces</h2>
						<p>
							You will always want to move all of your pieces to get them involved in the action. Castling your king is also highly recommended. You're essentially trying to get all of your army involved in the fight. Generally you'll want most of your pieces in or around the center of the board, as that's the scene of most of the action.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Checkmating Consistently</h2>
						<p>
							An important skill to have for you is to be able to actually win a won game of chess. The two most common consistent mates are the 'protected queen' mate (sometimes called 'Splattermate' in the lessons) and the 'ladder' mate. Examples of both of these are shown on the next slide over.
						</p>
						<p>
							The way to actually get these mates is by a process called 'trading down'. When you are ahead some material you pursue equal trades. Eventually, barring any loss of material yourself, the extra material will allow you to take pawns with impunity and promote your own pawn. Once you've made another queen you can proceed to checkmate.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Primary Focus</h2>
						<p>
							Your primary focus for the games should be on taking your opponent's hanging pieces and not hanging any pieces yourself. This is sufficient to beat most of the kids that you'll play with. In my experience they'll typically hang a few pieces early on. If you take them and then trade down, you'll be able to checkmate from there.
						</p>
						<p>
							While there are certainly more advanced strategies and tactics to learn and practice, a good majority of our kids are not at the stage where that's necessary to beat them. <strong>It is important that you play your best against the students.</strong>

						<h1>Teaching Tips</h1>
					</section>

					<section>
						This section is primarily intended to help with how you teach the actual lessons. You may find things that work better for you, but most of these should be pretty applicable to anyone.
